*Alchemy of the UdK Berlin* is a format created as part of *UdK wants to know* in collaboration with the Museum für Werte. All members of the UdK community - students, teachers, staff, alumni and many more - are invited to take part in a participatory process in which they can contribute to the further development of the UdK Berlin's visual identity.

The observations, insights and creative impressions gathered from *UdK wants to know* will be carefully analyzed and integrated into the development process of the new visual identity of the Berlin University of the Arts. Your thoughts and ideas will become an important part of the design and direction of our future identity. The observations, insights and creative impressions gathered from the above-mentioned formats and the survey will be presented to the public in a participatory, experimental exhibition, and there will be another opportunity to get involved and become part of the exhibition on site, thus allowing further impressions to flow in.
