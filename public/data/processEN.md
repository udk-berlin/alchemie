Here you will find stories, anecdotes and reflections of the UdK community, which act as a snapshot of the UdK Berlin. It offers a small selection of reflections on the institution, which will be expanded again and again, and you are invited to explore shared narratives but also to become part of them and thus make excerpts of our UdK history visible.

# Background

The alchemy of UdK Berlin is a format created as part of UdK will's wissen in collaboration with the Museum für Werte.  All members of the UdK community - students, teachers, staff, alumni and many more - are invited to take part in a participatory process in which they can contribute to the further development of the UdK Berlin's visual identity.

UdK wants to know is a platform to collect the diverse voices of the UdK community in a snapshot. Various formats such as association rounds, surveys and creative projects such as The Alchemy of the UdK Berlin with the formats Grundrauschen, UdK Plenum and Alchemy Sessions create the opportunity to actively participate in the process.

If you would also like to submit anecdotes, please send them to alchemie@udk-berlin.de with the corresponding value.

The collected observations, insights and creative impressions from UdK will's wissen will be carefully analyzed and integrated into the development process of the new visual identity of the Berlin University of the Arts. Your thoughts and ideas will become an important part of the design and direction of our future appearance. The observations, insights and creative impressions gathered from the above-mentioned formats and the survey will be presented to the public in a participatory, experimental exhibition, and there will be another opportunity to get involved and become part of the exhibition on site, thus allowing further impressions to flow in. We would like to invite you to do so:
